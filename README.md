## Description

Resource monitor that shows usage and stats for processor, memory, disks, network and processes.

## Features

* Easy to use, with a game inspired menu system.
* Fast and "mostly" responsive UI with UP, DOWN keys process selection.
* Function for showing detailed stats for selected process.
* Ability to filter processes.
* Easy switching between sorting options.
* Send SIGTERM, SIGKILL, SIGINT to selected process.
* UI menu for changing all config file options.
* Auto scaling graph for network usage.
* Shows message in menu if new version is available

## Themes

Bashtop now has theme support and a function to download missing local themes from repository.

See [themes](themes) folder for available themes.

Let me know if you want to contribute with new themes.

## Upcoming

#### (Mac OSX and *BSD support)

Currently rewriting to use python3 [psutil](https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil) for data collection instead of linux specific tools.
This will add python 3 and psutil as dependencies, but will make bashtop cross platform compatible.

~~This will be in a new branch called bashtop-psutil when I'm done with initial testing~~

This will be integrated in to main version when done and add the possibility to switch between psutil and linux tools for users running linux.

#### Update

Work on a complete python port will begin this summer. My aim is to keep it compatible with pypy3 for a lot of added efficiency.

Bash(py)top?

## Support and funding

Bug fixes and updates might be slow during normal workdays since I work full time as an industrial worker and don't have much time or energy left during the week.
I'm looking into ways of funding this project that would allow me to take off time from my day job to work on this.

Any advice on how to get funding for open source projects is very welcome!

#### Update

You can now sponsor this project through github, see [my sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/aristocratos) for options.

Also added donation links for [paypal](https://paypal.me/aristocratos) and [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/aristocratos).

Any support is greatly appreciated!

## Compatibility

Should work on most modern linux distributions.

For correct display, a terminal with support for:

* 24-bit truecolor
* Wide characters

Also needs a UTF8 locale and a font that covers:

* Unicode Block “Braille Patterns” U+2800 - U+28FF
* Unicode Block “Geometric Shapes” U+25A0 - U+25FF
* Unicode Block "Box Drawing" and "Block Elements" U+2500 - U+259F

#### Notice

Dropbear seems to not be able to set correct locale. So if accessing bashtop over ssh, OpenSSH is recommended.

## Dependencies

**[bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)** (v4.4 or later) Script functionality will most probably break with earlier versions.
Bash version 5 is highly recommended to make use of $EPOCHREALTIME variable instead of a lot of external date command calls.

**[GNU Core Utilities](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/)**

**[GNU Grep](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/)**

**[ps from procps-ng](https://gitlab.com/procps-ng/procps)** (v3.1.15 or later)

**[sed](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/)**

**[awk](https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/)**

(Optional) **[lm-sensors](https://github.com/lm-sensors/lm-sensors)** Needed to show CPU temperatures

(Optional) **[curl](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html)** (v7.16.2 or later) Needed if you want messages about updates and the ability to download themes.

(Optional) **[iostat (part of sysstat)](https://github.com/sysstat/sysstat)** Needed if you want disk read/write stats

## Configurability

All options changeable from within UI.
Config files stored in "$HOME/.config/bashtop" folder

#### bashtop.cfg: (auto generated if not found)

#? Config file for bashtop v. 0.8.28

#* Color theme, looks for a .theme file in "$HOME/.config/bashtop/themes", "Default" for builtin default theme
color_theme="Default"

#* Update time in milliseconds, increases automatically if set below internal loops processing time, recommended 2000 ms or above for better sample times for graphs
update_ms="2500"

#* Processes sorting, "pid" "program" "arguments" "threads" "user" "memory" "cpu lazy" "cpu responsive" "tree"
#* "cpu lazy" updates sorting over time, "cpu responsive" updates sorting directly at a cpu usage cost
proc_sorting="cpu lazy"

#* Reverse sorting order, "true" or "false"
proc_reversed="false"

#* Check cpu temperature, only works if "sensors" command is available and have values for "Package" and "Core"

disks_filter=""

#* Enable check for new version from github.com/aristocratos/bashtop at start
